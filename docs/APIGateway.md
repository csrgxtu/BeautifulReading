1, The following link tells me how to use loopback with Swagger  
[Building Enterprise APIs with StrongLoop Support for Swagger 2.0](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/enterprise-api-swagger-2-0-loopback/?_ga=1.152537274.2042875840.1441599554)  
2, An example that use LoopBack and MoogoDB to illustrate the usage of the LoopBack API Framework  
[Let LoopBack Do It: A Walkthrough of the Node API Framework You've Been Dreaming Of](http://www.toptal.com/nodejs/let-loopback-do-it-a-walkthrough-of-the-node-api-framework-you-ve-been-dreaming-of)

4, LoopBack Support process management even within docker
